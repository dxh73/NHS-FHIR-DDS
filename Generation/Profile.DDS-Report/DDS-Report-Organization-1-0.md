The FHIR Organization Resource is defined as a formally or informally recognized grouping of people or organizations formed for the purpose of achieving some form of collective action. Includes companies, institutions, corporations, departments, community groups, healthcare practice groups, etc.
This resource may be used in a shared registry of contact and other information for various organizations or it can be used merely as a support for other resources that need to reference organizations, perhaps as a document, message or as a contained resource. If using a registry approach, it is entirely possible for multiple registries to exist, each dealing with different types or levels of organization.
The Organization resource often exists as a hierarchy of organization resources, using the part-of property to provide the association of the child to its parent organization.
